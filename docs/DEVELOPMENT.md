# Developing OpenLogi

This document covers the local development workflow for OpenLogi. For end-user
build instructions, see the [README](../README.md).

## Toolchain

- Stable Rust (Edition 2024, MSRV 1.98 — the floor tracks current stable)
- macOS: Xcode 26+ with the optional **Metal Toolchain** component. The Metal
  Toolchain is what GPUI's `gpui_macos` build script compiles shaders with; the
  version floor is `actool`, which packaging uses to compile the app icon from
  its Icon Composer document. `OPENLOGI_DEVELOPER_DIR` overrides which Xcode is
  used when several are installed.
- Linux: system libraries — on Debian/Ubuntu:
  `sudo apt-get install libudev-dev gcc g++ clang libfontconfig-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libssl-dev libzstd-dev pkg-config`
- `create-dmg` for packaging (`brew install create-dmg`); `cargo-bundle` is
  installed automatically by `cargo run -p xtask -- macos bundle`

## Building from source

Nix/devenv is optional. A normal Rust toolchain is enough.

### Without Nix

```sh
# rustup installs the stable toolchain pinned in rust-toolchain.toml
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# macOS: full Xcode 26+ with the Metal Toolchain (not only Command Line Tools)
# Linux: see system libraries under Toolchain above
# optional helpers: brew install cmake create-dmg sccache
git clone https://github.com/AprilNEA/OpenLogi
cd OpenLogi
cargo run -p openlogi --release -- list
cargo run -p openlogi-desktop --release
```

If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net) without devenv installed, `.envrc`
prints a notice and leaves your shell alone. Install rustup/cargo yourself
and keep working.

### With devenv (optional)

`devenv.nix` provisions sccache, the stable Rust toolchain, platform libraries,
nfpm on Linux, and the macOS packaging/env helpers GPUI needs
(`create-dmg`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`, and `SDKROOT`). Tasks:

```sh
devenv tasks run openlogi:gui      # run the desktop app
devenv tasks run openlogi:check    # host-OS gate: fmt + clippy + tests + rustdoc
devenv tasks run openlogi:ci       # every GitHub Actions CI job this host can reproduce
devenv tasks run openlogi:dmg      # build the macOS DMG
devenv tasks run openlogi:i18n-upload    # upload English source strings to Crowdin
devenv tasks run openlogi:i18n-download  # download translations and run i18n tests
```

After a `devenv.nix` change, reload direnv so the new env takes effect:

```sh
direnv reload    # or: exit your shell and `cd` back in
```

Without that, GPUI's `gpui_macos` build script can't find Apple's `metal`
shader compiler, and link errors about missing `_write` / `_sysconf` /
`_waitpid` symbols show up because the Nix `apple-sdk-14.4` stub doesn't
expose `libSystem` the way Apple's real linker wants.

### Nix package

The root Flake exposes native `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux` packages plus
the NixOS module. It is separate from the devenv shell:

```sh
nix flake check --all-systems --no-build  # evaluate every output
nix build .#openlogi                      # build + test this host's package
nix run .#openlogi -- list                # run the packaged CLI
```

The package expression and NixOS module live beside the other Linux packaging
inputs in `packaging/linux/`. `nix fmt` formats all Nix expressions through the
Flake's pinned formatter.

### Dev app bundle (macOS)

On macOS the desktop binary is launched from inside a throwaway
`target/dev/OpenLogi.app` — a Cargo `runner` wired in `.cargo/config.toml`
(`.cargo/run-macos.sh`) that hands the build to `xtask macos dev-bundle`. This
makes the dev build show as **OpenLogi Dev** in the menu bar and Dock, with the
real app icon; a bare `cargo run` binary has no bundle, so macOS would otherwise
fall back to the `openlogi-desktop` executable name and a generic icon. The
binary is hardlinked in (no copy) unless the bundle is being signed, and the
icon is generated on demand. The runner is a transparent passthrough for
everything else (the CLI, tests); set `OPENLOGI_DEV_BUNDLE=0` to launch the raw
`openlogi-desktop` binary instead.

Each run also stops the dev agent and overlay left behind by the previous one,
then starts the freshly built agent and waits for its IPC socket before the
GUI launches — so the window connects immediately instead of sitting on its
connecting frame while the GUI's production fallback re-spawns the agent.
The helpers are launched through LaunchServices so they get their own TCC
identity, which also means they are not children of the GUI: closing its
window or pressing Ctrl-C ends only the GUI, and a surviving dev agent
relaunches itself ~20 s later once its watcher notices the rewritten binary.
Set `OPENLOGI_DEV_AGENT=0` to run against an agent you started yourself —
nothing is stopped, built, embedded, or started then.

Packaged local dev bundles (`cargo run` and
`cargo run -p xtask -- macos bundle`) use `-dev` bundle identifiers and the
`openlogi-dev` XDG profile (`~/.config/openlogi-dev`,
`~/.local/share/openlogi-dev`, and its own `agent.sock`). That keeps the dev
GUI and agent from sharing the installed production app's Accessibility grant,
single-instance lock, config, or IPC socket.

Those identifiers are a channel, not a guess from the build type:
`macos bundle` takes `--channel dev|production` (dev by default) and verifies
what it stamped, and `macos dmg` refuses a non-production bundle once it is
given a signing identity. Reproduce the shipped layout locally with
`--channel production`, but don't sign and run it — it would take over the
installed app's grants and config, which is exactly what releases
0.6.24–0.6.26 did in reverse.

To install the CLI binary on `PATH`:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/openlogi
```

## Developing the GUI without hardware

`openlogi-agent-mock` serves the real agent IPC contract from a scripted
in-memory inventory, so the desktop app can be developed with no Logitech
device (or receiver) attached:

```sh
cargo run -p openlogi-agent --bin openlogi-agent-mock   # then, in another terminal:
OPENLOGI_DEV_AGENT=0 cargo run -p openlogi-desktop
```

The mock defaults itself to the `openlogi-dev` profile (as if `OPENLOGI_PROFILE=dev`
were set), which is the profile the dev app bundle already uses — so it meets the
dev GUI on the dev socket, and an installed *release* build, which is on the
production profile, keeps running untouched. (A locally built bundle installed
into `/Applications` carries `-dev` identifiers and therefore shares the dev
profile: it and the mock contend for the same lock, and whichever starts second
exits.) `OPENLOGI_DEV_AGENT=0` keeps the runner from building and embedding
the real agent for the GUI to auto-spawn; add `OPENLOGI_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_AGENT=1`
if your installed production agent is running, since the runner's guard against
it predates the profile split and cannot know the dev GUI is on a separate
socket. Pass `OPENLOGI_PROFILE=prod` to serve the production socket instead; the
mock then contends for the production agent's single-instance lock and refuses
to start while it is running.

The script covers an online mouse (DPI and SmartShift writes persist and read
back, battery drains so poll-driven repaints are visible), an offline mouse, a
lighting-capable keyboard, a directly-attached device, and a full Bolt pairing
flow (discovery → passkey → paired). Its agent version carries a `-mock` suffix,
so a mock session is identifiable in the UI. It is a dev tool only and is never
bundled.

### Component gallery

Use the debug-only component gallery to review shared controls across light and
dark themes and every supported interface scale without config, IPC, or hardware:

```sh
OPENLOGI_COMPONENT_GALLERY=1 cargo run -p openlogi-desktop
```

Gallery mode opens one isolated window and bypasses the normal single-instance,
config, agent, asset-sync, and updater startup paths. The environment variable is
ignored by release builds.

## Project layout

```
crates/
  openlogi/         the `openlogi` binary — a thin wrapper over openlogi-cli
  openlogi-core/    types, config (TOML), paths, button + action catalog — no HID, no async
  openlogi-inject/  OS input synthesis: CGEvent, uinput/MPRIS, and SendInput
  openlogi-hidpp/   vendored HID++ protocol crate (lib name `hidpp`)
  openlogi-hid/     device discovery, HID++ reads/writes, and control capture over async-hid
  openlogi-assets/  device-render registry schema + cached HTTP fetch from OpenLogi asset mirrors
  openlogi-cli/     CLI implementation: command tree + `run()`, called by the `openlogi` binary
  openlogi-agent-core/  shared orchestration + the agent/GUI IPC contract
  openlogi-agent/   the `openlogi-agent` binary — background agent owning device I/O and the hook
  openlogi-hook/    OS mouse hook: macOS CGEventTap, Linux evdev/uinput, Windows WH_MOUSE_LL
  openlogi-ui/      presentation shared by the two GPUI processes: ring geometry/icons,
                    the GPUI asset source, locale negotiation — gpui, no gpui-component
  openlogi-desktop/     the `openlogi-desktop` binary — GPUI + gpui-component IPC client
  openlogi-overlay/ the `openlogi-overlay` binary — the cursor-centred Actions Ring
```

## Local CI

The PR test pipeline is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. To run every job this
machine can reproduce — including typos, MSRV, cargo-deny, and the Windows
cross-lint the host-OS gate does not run:

```sh
cargo xtask ci
cargo xtask ci --list                        # job → command table
devenv tasks run openlogi:ci                 # same, from devenv
```

The runner sets `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` the way CI does. Jobs that need another
OS are reported as skipped; a skip is not a pass. The full job map (and which
diff requires which job) is [`.claude/rules/ci.md`](../.claude/rules/ci.md).

### Pre-push gate

Before pushing, the host-OS subset must pass:

```sh
export RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps \
  --document-private-items --exclude openlogi-ui --exclude openlogi-desktop \
  --exclude openlogi-overlay --exclude openlogi-agent
```

Equivalent to `devenv tasks run openlogi:check`. That is **not** the full
pipeline: typos, Linux clippy, Windows clippy, MSRV, cargo-deny, and the shell
lint (shellcheck + shfmt) are separate CI jobs. Reproduce those with
`cargo xtask ci` or the commands in `.claude/rules/ci.md`.

## Packaging the macOS DMG

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- macos package    # → target/release/OpenLogi.dmg
# Cross-compile a distribution DMG (aarch64 or x86_64):
cargo run -p xtask -- macos package --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

Environment overrides:

- `OPENLOGI_BUNDLE_ASSETS=1` — bundle every device render into the `.app` for a
  fully offline build (default: fetched on demand at first launch).
- `OPENLOGI_SIGN_IDENTITY=<identity>` — codesign the `.app` and `.dmg` with the
  given Developer ID.
- `OPENLOGI_DMG_BACKGROUND_URL=<url>` — override the branded DMG background
  TIFF URL (default: `https://assets.openlogi.org/dmg/dmg-background.tiff`).

The local packaging command and release workflow both use the same branded DMG
layout: a 760×480 background image in a 760×512 Finder window, with 128px icons
positioned at `(212, 250)` for `OpenLogi.app` and `(548, 250)` for
`Applications`.

## Packaging Linux `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.pkg.tar.zst`

Requires [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/) on `PATH`; the package arch is
derived from the host (override with `PKG_ARCH`):

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- linux package
# → target/release/openlogi_*.deb / .rpm / .pkg.tar.zst
```

The package contents (binaries, udev rules, systemd user unit, desktop entry,
icon) are declared in `packaging/linux/nfpm.yaml`.

The Nix package uses the same shared resources and is declared in
`packaging/linux/package.nix`; see the Nix package section above for its build
commands.

## Release updater publishing

Tagged releases still attach DMGs and `SHA256SUMS` to GitHub Releases for manual
downloads and the Homebrew cask. The release workflow also publishes the same
DMGs to Cloudflare R2 and writes a static updater manifest at:

```text
${OPENLOGI_UPDATE_BASE_URL}/channels/stable/latest.json
```

The app embeds that manifest URL at build time via
`OPENLOGI_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL`, derived from `OPENLOGI_UPDATE_BASE_URL` in the
release workflow. Release builds also embed `OPENLOGI_UPDATE_MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEY`
and run with `Verification::Strict`: an update is installed only if the manifest
asset carries a minisign signature that verifies against that key, plus a
matching SHA-256. A build without the key embedded (local/dev) fails closed —
the update check errors rather than installing an unverified artifact.

Configure the R2/update settings in one 1Password item referenced by the GitHub
secret `OP_R2_SECRET_ITEM`. The item must contain:

- `OPENLOGI_UPDATE_BASE_URL` — public HTTPS base URL, for example
  `https://updates.openlogi.org`.
- `OPENLOGI_UPDATE_MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEY` — base64 minisign public key embedded in
  the app and used to verify updater artifacts.
- `OPENLOGI_UPDATE_MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY` — the passwordless minisign secret key
  file, **base64-encoded** (`base64 < minisign.key`), used only in the release
  publish job to sign DMGs before `latest.json` is generated. It is stored
  base64 (not raw) so its two lines survive 1Password's paste handling; the
  workflow decodes it, mirroring the GitHub App key.
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID` — Cloudflare account ID used for the S3 endpoint.
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET` — bucket name.
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — R2 S3 access key.
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — R2 S3 secret key.

The workflow uploads immutable artifacts under `/releases/<tag>/` and only the
channel manifest under `/channels/stable/latest.json` is mutable.

The manifest is generated by the workspace `xtask` helper:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- release latest-json \
  --dist dist \
  --tag v0.2.0 \
  --base-url https://updates.openlogi.org \
  --output dist/latest.json
```

## Crowdin translation sync

`.github/workflows/crowdin.yml` syncs GUI locales with
[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/openlogi) and opens a `crowdin/i18n` PR
when a **real** translation value improved — nightly, and on master pushes that
touch English sources (`en.toml`), `.config/crowdin.yml`, the Crowdin workflow,
the merge script under `.github/scripts/i18n/`, or the shared GitHub App token
action.

**How it helps translation**

| | Role |
|--|--|
| `en.toml` (git) | English source of truth; stable semantic keys grouped by product-domain tables |
| All `locales/*.toml` in git | Same keys as `en.toml` (parity test); seed Crowdin per language |
| Crowdin project | Where people improve non-English **values** |
| Merge script | Applies only values ≠ English; restores keys sparse exports omit |
| Bot PR (`crowdin/i18n`) | Only when a non-English value actually changed |

Call sites use stable keys such as `device.connected`. Feature PRs add
new keys to **every** locale file in the same change. English wording can change
without renaming the key or updating call sites. Crowdin does not invent
translations; it only stores and syncs them. A raw Crowdin download is unsafe:
untranslated strings come back as English (#549), and
`skip_untranslated_strings` overwrites catalogs with sparse files that delete
keys (#552). The workflow always **snapshots → download → merge** via
`.github/scripts/i18n/merge_crowdin_download.py` so catalogs stay complete and only real
translations land in git.

Each run:

1. Snapshots every `locales/*.toml`.
2. Uploads `en.toml` **sources**.
3. Uploads **per-language translations** already in git (`import_eq_suggestions`
   off so `value == English` is not stored as a finished translation).
4. Downloads Crowdin’s export (`skip_untranslated_strings`; sparse is fine).
5. Merges the export into the snapshot (English fill-in ignored; omitted keys
   kept; headers / `_version` preserved).
6. Opens/updates `crowdin/i18n` only when the working tree still differs.

Like the release workflow, the job reads its credentials from one 1Password
item referenced by the GitHub secret `OP_CROWDIN_SECRET_ITEM`. The item must
contain:

- `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` — the numeric Crowdin project id.
- `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` — a Crowdin API token with access to the project.

Grant the token only these scopes and restrict its granular access to the
OpenLogi project:

- Projects (List, Get, Create, Edit) — Read.
- Translation Status — Read Only.
- Source files & strings — Read and Write.
- Translations — Read and Write.

Missing or invalid credentials fail the workflow. Translation PRs run the
normal CI checks, including the locale key parity test (every catalog must match
`en.toml` key-for-key). The workflow uses the existing `OP_GITHUB_APP_ITEM` to
mint a short-lived token for pushing its translation branch and opening the PR;
the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` remains read-only. Checkout runs with
`persist-credentials: false` and the origin remote is rewritten to the app token
so git push does not inherit the read-only Actions credential.

Local helpers (with Crowdin credentials configured):

```sh
devenv tasks run openlogi:i18n-upload    # en.toml sources + per-language translations
devenv tasks run openlogi:i18n-download  # download + merge + i18n tests
python3 .github/scripts/i18n/merge_crowdin_download.py --self-test
```
