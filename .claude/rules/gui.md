# GUI (GPUI + gpui-component)

- The UI stack is GPUI + gpui-component — a settled choice; don't propose alternatives.
- **Three crates, not one.** `openlogi-desktop` is the settings app; `openlogi-overlay` is
  the Actions Ring helper, a separate process and a pure IPC client; `openlogi-ui` is
  what they share — ring geometry/icons, the GPUI asset source, the locale catalogs.
  The overlay must never depend on `openlogi-desktop`. Before putting anything in
  `openlogi-ui`, check both binaries actually need it: every dependency added there is
  also added to the overlay, which is why `gpui-component` is *not* one of them.
- One catalog, in `openlogi-ui/locales/`; the negotiation over its codes lives in
  `openlogi_core::locale` (the platform-free core, where the GUI-less agent reaches it
  for the tray). `t!` resolves against a backend the invoking crate must generate
  itself, so each localized binary — the app, the overlay, and the agent — expands its
  own `rust_i18n::i18n!` over that shared directory by relative path. A wrong path
  there compiles to an **empty catalog** rather than an error, and every string
  silently renders as its semantic key — `the_shared_catalog_is_wired_up` in
  `openlogi-overlay` and `openlogi-agent` is what makes that fail loudly.
- `gpui`/`gpui_platform` track zed's default branch on purpose; the compatible zed
  commit is pinned **only in `Cargo.lock`**, in lockstep with the `gpui-component` rev.
  After any `cargo add`/`cargo update`, check the pins didn't move; restore with
  `cargo update -p gpui --precise <rev>`.
- Two color systems must agree: the bespoke `theme.rs` `Palette` (hand-painted
  surfaces) and gpui-component's `cx.theme()` (widget chrome). Only the `ThemeMode` is
  shared between them. A "white box under dark UI" or a surface that doesn't flip with
  the OS appearance is a ThemeMode wiring bug — fix that, not per-element `bg()`.
- The same split exists for sizing: gpui-component's size ladder (xs 20 / sm 24 /
  md 32 / lg 44 px) has no step at the app's 30 px control rhythm
  (`theme::CONTROL_H`), and its custom `Size::Size` heights are broken (`input_h`
  falls through to 24 px, text scales with the size). Build standalone form
  controls — filled/outline buttons, single-line inputs, selects — with
  `ui::components::{control_button, control_input, control_select}`, which take
  `.small()` typography and pin `CONTROL_H`. A bare `.small()` on one of those is
  the "squashed control" bug; ghost/link affordances, `.compact()` inline buttons,
  pills, and icon-only toggles stay on the stock ladder deliberately.
- Trait imports must be unconditional for cross-platform widgets: a
  `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`-gated `use gpui::StatefulInteractiveElement as _;`
  compiles fine locally but breaks the Linux/Windows CI jobs the moment an ungated
  element calls `.id(..).on_click(..)`. When adding such an element, ungate the import.
- **An icon is never a text character.** `×` for close, `·` for a centre press, `+`
  for add, `←`/`→` for anything — all of them are bugs, not shortcuts. A glyph's
  advance width is set by the font, so a row of them does not align and no two read
  at the same weight; a screen reader announces "multiplication sign". Reach for
  `IconName` first, then a vendored SVG. Punctuation *between* text stays text: `·`
  as a metadata separator and `…` on a menu item that opens a dialog are correct.
- Icons are not limited to gpui-component's `IconName` (which is lucide, generated
  from the `gpui-component-assets` icon directory): vendor any SVG (must use
  `stroke="currentColor"`) into `crates/openlogi-ui/action-icons/`, register it in
  that crate's `action_icons.rs` `ACTION_ICONS`, render via
  `Icon::empty().path("action-icons/….svg")` or `svg().path(..)`. Both binaries
  serve the same set — the overlay pays for every entry, so prefer `IconName` when
  it has the icon. The overlay itself has no `IconName`: it does not depend on
  gpui-component, so anything both processes draw (the ring's cancel target) has to
  be vendored and named through one shared const, never spelled out on each side.
- `Icon` does **not** keep its own default size: its render overwrites the base
  style refinement with the caller's, so a bare `Icon` falls through to the current
  font size instead of the 16px `Default` sets. Any icon meant to line up with a
  neighbouring `svg().size_4()` needs an explicit `.size_4()`.
- Config panels/tabs gate on measured or last-good `Capabilities`, not directly on
  device `kind` — kind is identity-only (icon/label). The sole kind-derived fallback
  is `Capabilities::presumed_from_kind` in `tabs_for` for a never-probed offline
  device; keep it centralized. A new panel means a new capability in
  `Capabilities::from_feature_ids` plus a `tabs_for` arm.
- Mouse-diagram hotspots come from Logi metadata; if the metadata omits a button
  marker, omit the button — never synthesize hotspot positions.
- Keep render helpers statically typed (`impl IntoElement` or a concrete element) until
  a genuinely heterogeneous branch, collection, callback, or stored field requires
  `AnyElement`. Prefer one typed `.when()` / `.when_some()` / `.children()` pipeline to
  branching early and erasing each result.
- Key dynamic `ElementId`s by a stable domain identity, not a filtered position or a
  formatted display label. Derive reusable-component child IDs from the component's
  caller-provided root ID so multiple instances cannot share focus or scroll state.
- A view, entity, or app service owns every `Task` and `Subscription` whose work belongs
  to its lifetime. Use `.detach()` only for true process-lifetime work or bounded
  one-shots whose completion is safe after the initiating view disappears.
- When an async UI operation captures inputs that may change before it completes
  (device, route, query, selection, or request), capture their identity or generation
  at launch and compare again before committing the result. Cancellation is useful,
  but is not the stale-result fence.
- Never call a function that reads `AppState` (menu rebuild, most `windows::`/`app::`
  helpers) from inside an `AppState::update` closure — the entity lease is still held
  and the re-entrant read panics ("cannot read … while it is already being updated";
  the 0.8.0 language-switch crash). Run such side effects after the update returns,
  the way `runtime.rs` orders its rebuilds, or `cx.defer` them from within.
- A `tr!` string stored in entity state goes stale on a live language switch: an
  `InputState` placeholder keeps the text it was constructed with, and a cached
  localized description keeps its old locale. Placeholders re-derive in the owning
  render via `ui::components::localize_placeholder` (guarded — never call
  `set_placeholder` bare per render, it notifies unconditionally); other cached
  localized text recomputes on `StateEvent::LanguageChanged`. Native window titles
  are restamped by `windows::retitle_open`, already wired into
  `AppState::set_language`.
- When changing reusable controls, prefer focused `#[gpui::test]` behavior contracts
  over screenshot coverage: keyboard activation, disabled no-op, controlled selected
  state/callbacks, and independent parent/child interaction targets.
- Verifying UI changes needs the running app: re-`cargo run -p openlogi-desktop` (a plain
  `cargo build` leaves the dev bundle stale) after quitting the previous instance
  (singleton lock). The GUI shows only the empty state unless the agent is running.
- A visible UI change is not accepted from compile/tests alone. Run the real app through
  each representative affected state, inspect a fresh screenshot, and attach it for
  review. State any OS or hardware state that was not exercised. Screenshots catch
  layout/theme regressions; an exercised behavior or focused test is still the proof
  of behavior.
