//! Privacy-permission status, and the deep links that take a user to the
//! system UI for fixing it.
//!
//! **Reading a status never prompts.** Prompting belongs to whichever process
//! owns the resource: the agent raises the Accessibility prompt because it owns
//! the event tap, and opens HID itself. A prompt from the wrong process records
//! the grant against the wrong code-signing identity (issue #214), so this
//! crate exposes only the non-prompting half plus [`open_pane`] — which is also
//! why no general-purpose macOS permission crate fits: they assume one app
//! asking for itself.
//!
//! ## macOS
//!
//! Two permissions matter: **Accessibility** (the hook's event tap) and **Input
//! Monitoring** (opening HID devices via `IOHIDManager`). **Screen Recording**
//! is needed for the host screen-sampler lighting effect. **Bluetooth** is
//! surfaced for completeness — OpenLogi reaches BLE mice through `IOHIDManager`,
//! so it usually reads [`PermissionStatus::Unknown`].
//!
//! Accessibility status is not read here: the agent owns the tap, so
//! `openlogi_hook::has_accessibility` is the source of truth.
//!
//! ## Linux
//!
//! Access is device-file permissions rather than consent dialogs: write to
//! `/dev/uinput` (the evdev/uinput hook's virtual devices) and read/write to
//! `/dev/hidraw*` (HID++ to the Bolt receiver or a direct connection). Both
//! come from the OpenLogi udev rules.
