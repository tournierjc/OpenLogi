//! Agent IPC client.
//!
//! The agent owns all device I/O, so the GUI never opens a device — it connects
//! to the agent's local socket and (a) keeps one [`Agent::observe`] request open
//! for the agent's state, and (b) forwards "apply now" / "read" device commands.
//! Both run on one dedicated OS thread with a tokio runtime (the GPUI thread owns
//! no async runtime): results cross back over `mpsc` to the GPUI loop.
//!
//! There is no poll cadence to tune. `observe` carries a generation, and the
//! agent answers the moment its state differs from the one this client last saw,
//! so the GUI is told *when* to look instead of asking on a timer — and because
//! every answer is the complete state, a reconnect needs no resynchronisation:
//! ask again with generation 0 and the next answer is the whole truth.
//!
//! What is left to time is failure. `launch::spawn_agent` brings the agent up
//! when the socket stays down — gated by [`SpawnReflex`], which fires
//! immediately for an agent that was never reachable but gives a lost
//! connection [`SPAWN_AFTER_LOSS`] first (the deliberate quits and the
//! supervised restarts announce themselves within that window) and never
//! fires at a live agent newer than this GUI. A stretch without a
//! usable connection longer than [`UNREACHABLE_AFTER`] is pushed to the GUI as
//! [`GuiUpdate::Unreachable`] so the window can say so instead of waiting
//! forever. A dead agent is noticed the moment the socket closes; a *hung* one
//! is noticed when its hold window passes without an answer.
